NAME
----
zctx - working with 0MQ contexts

SYNOPSIS
--------
----
//  Structure passed to threads created via this class
typedef struct {
    zctx_t *ctx;                //  Context shared with parent thread
    void *pipe;                 //  Pipe to parent thread (PAIR)
    void *arg;                  //  Application argument
} zthread_t;

//  Create new context, returns context object, replaces zmq_init
zctx_t *
    zctx_new (void);

//  Destroy context and all sockets in it, replaces zmq_term
void
    zctx_destroy (zctx_t **self_p);
    
//  Raise default I/O threads from 1, for crazy heavy applications    
void
    zctx_set_iothreads (zctx_t *self, int iothreads);
    
//  Set msecs to flush sockets when closing them
void 
    zctx_set_linger (zctx_t *self, int linger);

//  Create socket within this context, replaces zmq_socket
void *
    zctx_socket_new (zctx_t *self, int type);

//  Destroy socket, replaces zmq_close
void
    zctx_socket_destroy (zctx_t *self, void *socket);

//  Create thread, return PAIR socket to talk to thread. The child thread
//  receives a (zthread_t *) object including a zctx, a pipe back to the
//  creating thread, and the arg passed in this call.
void *
    zctx_thread_new (zctx_t *self, void *(*thread_fn) (void *), void *arg);

//  Self test of this class

//  Global signal indicator, TRUE when user presses Ctrl-C or the process
//  gets a SIGTERM signal.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The zctx class wraps 0MQ contexts. It manages open sockets in the context
and automatically closes these before terminating the context. It provides
a simple way to set the linger timeout on sockets, and configure contexts
for number of I/O threads. Sets-up signal (interrrupt) handling for the
process.

The zctx class has these main features:

* Tracks all open sockets and automatically closes them before calling
zmq_term(). This avoids an infinite wait on open sockets.

* Automatically configures sockets with a ZMQ_LINGER timeout you can
define, and which defaults to zero. The default behavior of zctx is
therefore like 0MQ/2.0, immediate termination with loss of any pending
messages. You can set any linger timeout you like by calling the
zctx_set_linger() method.

* Moves the iothreads configuration to a separate method, so that default
usage is 1 I/O thread. Lets you configure this value.

* Sets up signal (SIGINT and SIGTERM) handling so that blocking calls
such as zmq_recv() and zmq_poll() will return when the user presses
Ctrl-C.

* Provides API to create child threads with a pipe (PAIR socket) to talk
to them.

One problem is when our application needs child threads. If we simply
use pthreads_create() we're faced with several issues. First, it's not
portable to legacy OSes like win32. Second, how can a child thread get
access to our zctx object? If we just pass it around, we'll end up
sharing the pipe socket (which we use to talk to the agent) between
threads, and that will then crash 0MQ. Sockets cannot be used from more
than one thread at a time.

So each child thread needs its own pipe to the agent. For the agent,
this is fine, it can talk to a million threads. But how do we create
those pipes in the child thread? We can't, not without help from the
main thread. The solution is to wrap thread creation, like we wrap
socket creation. To create a new thread, the app calls zctx_thread_new()
and this method creates a dedicated zctx object, with a pipe, and then
it passes that object to the newly minted child thread.

The neat thing is we can hide non-portable aspects. Windows is really a
mess when it comes to threads. Three different APIs, none of which is
really right, so you have to do rubbish like manually cleaning up when
a thread finishes. Anyhow, it's hidden in this class so you don't need
to worry.

Second neat thing about wrapping thread creation is we can make it a
more enriching experience for all involved. One thing I do often is use
a PAIR-PAIR pipe to talk from a thread to/from its parent. So this class
will automatically create such a pair for each thread you start.

EXAMPLE
-------
.From zctx_test method
----
static void *
s_test_thread (void *args_ptr)
{
    zthread_t *args = (zthread_t *) args_ptr;

    //  Create a socket to check it'll be properly deleted at exit
    zctx_socket_new (args->ctx, ZMQ_PUSH);

    //  Wait for our parent to ping us, and pong back
    char *ping = zstr_recv (args->pipe);
    free (ping);
    zstr_send (args->pipe, "pong");
    return NULL;
}

    //  Create and destroy a context without using it
    zctx_t *ctx = zctx_new ();
    assert (ctx);
    zctx_destroy (&ctx);
    assert (ctx == NULL);

    //  Create a context with many busy sockets, destroy it
    ctx = zctx_new ();
    zctx_set_iothreads (ctx, 1);
    zctx_set_linger (ctx, 5);       //  5 msecs
    void *s1 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_PAIR);
    void *s2 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_XREQ);
    void *s3 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_REQ);
    void *s4 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_REP);
    void *s5 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_PUB);
    void *s6 = zctx_socket_new (ctx, ZMQ_SUB);
    zmq_connect (s1, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");
    zmq_connect (s2, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");
    zmq_connect (s3, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");
    zmq_connect (s4, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");
    zmq_connect (s5, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");
    zmq_connect (s6, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555");

    //  Create a child thread, check it's safely alive
    void *pipe = zctx_thread_new (ctx, s_test_thread, NULL);
    zstr_send (pipe, "ping");
    char *pong = zstr_recv (pipe);
    assert (streq (pong, "pong"));
    free (pong);

    //  Everything should be cleanly closed now
    zctx_destroy (&ctx);
