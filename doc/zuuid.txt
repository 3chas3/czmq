NAME
----
zuuid - UUID support class

SYNOPSIS
--------
----
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The zuuid class generates UUIDs and provides methods for working with
them. If you build CZMQ with libuuid, on Unix/Linux, it will use that
library. On Windows it will use UuidCreate(). Otherwise it will use a
random number generator to produce convincing imitations of uuids.


EXAMPLE
-------
.From zuuid_test method
----
    //  Simple create/destroy test
    zuuid_t *self = zuuid_new ();
    assert (self);
    assert (strlen (zuuid_str (self)) == 32);
    zuuid_destroy (&self);
