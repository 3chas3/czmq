NAME
----
ztrie - simple trie for tokenizable strings

SYNOPSIS
--------
----
//  Creates a new ztrie.
CZMQ_EXPORT ztrie_t *
    ztrie_new (char delimiter);

//  Destroy the ztrie.
CZMQ_EXPORT void
    ztrie_destroy (ztrie_t **self_p);

//  Inserts a new route into the tree and attaches the data. Returns -1
//  if the route already exists, otherwise 0. This method takes ownership of
//  the provided data if a destroy_data_fn is provided.
CZMQ_EXPORT int
    ztrie_insert_route (ztrie_t *self, char *path, void *data, ztrie_destroy_data_fn *destroy_data_fn);

//  Removes a route from the trie and destroys its data. Returns -1 if the
//  route does not exists, otherwise 0.
CZMQ_EXPORT int
   ztrie_remove_route (ztrie_t *self, char *path);

//  Returns true if the path matches a route in the tree, otherwise false.
CZMQ_EXPORT bool
    ztrie_matches (ztrie_t *self, char *path);

//  Returns the data of a matched route from last ztrie_matches. If the path
//  did not match, returns NULL. Do not delete the data as it's owned by
//  ztrie.
CZMQ_EXPORT void *
    ztrie_hit_data (ztrie_t *self);

//  Returns the count of parameters that a matched route has.
CZMQ_EXPORT size_t
ztrie_hit_parameter_count (ztrie_t *self);

//  Returns the parameters of a matched route with named regexes from last
//  ztrie_matches. If the path did not match or the route did not contain any
//  named regexes, returns NULL.
CZMQ_EXPORT zhashx_t *
    ztrie_hit_parameters (ztrie_t *self);

//  Print properties of object
CZMQ_EXPORT void

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a variant of a trie or prefix tree where all the descendants of a
node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node. This
implementation is specialized for strings that can be tokenized by a delimiter
like a URL, URI or URN. Routes in the tree can be matched by regular expressions
and by using capturing groups parts of a matched route can be easily obtained.

Note that the performance for pure string based matching is okay but on short
strings zhash and zhashx are 3-4 times faster.

EXAMPLE
-------
.From ztrie_test method
----
//  Create a new trie for matching strings that can be tokenized by a slash
//  (e.g. URLs minus the protocol, address and port).
ztrie_t *self = ztrie_new ('/');
assert (self);

int ret = 0;

//  Let's start by inserting a couple of routes into the trie.
//  This one is for the route '/foo/bar' the slash at the beginning of the
//  route is important because everything before the first delimiter will be
//  discarded. A slash at the end of a route is optional though. The data
//  associated with this node is passed without destroy function which means
//  it must be destroyed by the caller.
int foo_bar_data = 10;
ret = ztrie_insert_route (self, "/foo/bar", &foo_bar_data, NULL);
assert (ret == 0);

//  Now suppose we like to match all routes that start with '/foo' but aren't
//  '/foo/bar'. This is possible by using regular expressions which are enclosed
//  in an opening and closing curly bracket. Tokens that contain regular
//  expressions are always match after string based tokens.
//  Note: There is no order in which regular expressions are sorted thus if you
//  enter multiple expressions for a route you will have to make sure they don't
//  have overlapping results. For example '{/foo/{[^/]+}' and '{/foo/{\d+}.
int foo_other_data = 100;
ret = ztrie_insert_route (self, "/foo/{[^/]+}", &foo_other_data, NULL);
assert (ret == 0);

//  Routes are identified by their endpoint, which is the last token of the route.
//  It is possible to insert routes for a node that already exists but isn't an
//  endpoint yet.
ret = ztrie_insert_route (self, "/foo", NULL, NULL);
assert (ret == 0);

//  If you try to insert a route which already exists the method will return -1.
ret = ztrie_insert_route (self, "/foo", NULL, NULL);
assert (ret == -1);

//  Of course you are allowed to remove routes, in case there is data associated with a
//  route and a destroy data function has been supplied that data will be destroyed.
ret = ztrie_remove_route (self, "/foo");
assert (ret == 0);

//  Removing a non existent route will  as well return -1.
ret = ztrie_remove_route (self, "/foo");
assert (ret == -1);

//  Removing a route with a regular expression must exactly match the entered one.
ret = ztrie_remove_route (self, "/foo/{[^/]+}");
assert (ret == 0);

//  Next we like to match a path by regular expressions and also extract matched
//  parts of a route. This can be done by naming the regular expression. The name of a
//  regular expression is entered at the beginning of the curly brackets and separated
//  by a colon from the regular expression. The fist one in this examples is named
//  'name' and names the expression '[^/]'. If there is no capturing group defined in
//  the expression the whole matched string will be associated with this parameter. In
//  case you don't like the get the whole matched string use a capturing group like
//  it have been done for the 'id' parameter. This is nice but you can even match as
//  many parameter for a token as you like. Therefore simply put the parameter names
//  separated by colons in front of the regular expression and make sure to add a
//  capturing group for each parameter. The first parameter will be associated with
//  the first capturing and so on.
char *data = (char *) malloc (80);
sprintf (data, "%s", "Hello World!");
ret = ztrie_insert_route (self, "/baz/{name:[^/]+}/{id:--(\\d+)}/{street:nr:(\\a+)(\\d+)}", data, NULL);
assert (ret == 0);

//  Test matches
bool hasMatch = false;

//  The route '/bar/foo' will fail to match as this route has never been inserted.
hasMatch = ztrie_matches (self, "/bar/foo");
assert (!hasMatch);

//  The route '/foo/bar' will match and we can obtain the data associated with it.
hasMatch = ztrie_matches (self, "/foo/bar");
assert (hasMatch);
int foo_bar_hit_data = *((int *) ztrie_hit_data (self));
assert (foo_bar_data == foo_bar_hit_data);

//  This route is part of another but is no endpoint itself thus the matches will fail.
hasMatch = ztrie_matches (self, "/baz/blub");
assert (!hasMatch);

//  This route will match our named regular expressions route. Thus we can extract data
//  from the route by their names.
hasMatch = ztrie_matches (self, "/baz/blub/--11/abc23");
assert (hasMatch);
char *match_data = (char *) ztrie_hit_data (self);
assert (streq ("Hello World!", match_data));
zhashx_t *parameters = ztrie_hit_parameters (self);
assert (zhashx_size (parameters) == 4);
assert (streq ("blub", (char *) zhashx_lookup (parameters, "name")));
assert (streq ("11", (char *) zhashx_lookup (parameters, "id")));
assert (streq ("abc", (char *) zhashx_lookup (parameters, "street")));
assert (streq ("23", (char *) zhashx_lookup (parameters, "nr")));
zhashx_destroy (&parameters);

free (data);
